# 🔧 Failed to Load Files - DEBUGGING & FIX

## ✅ **Issues Identified:**

### **1. File Persistence Path Issue**
- **Problem:** Data directory path might be incorrect
- **Fix:** Updated path to use `process.cwd()` instead of `__dirname`

### **2. Missing Debug Information**
- **Problem:** No visibility into what's happening during file loading
- **Fix:** Added comprehensive logging to track the process

### **3. Potential Data Loading Issues**
- **Problem:** `loadUploadHistory` might be failing silently
- **Fix:** Added error handling and debug output

## 🔧 **Files Modified:**

### **1. `src/main/services/UploadService.js`**
- **Fixed persistence path:** `path.join(process.cwd(), 'data', 'upload_history.json')`
- **Added debug logging:** Console output for troubleshooting
- **Enhanced error handling:** Better error messages

## 🎯 **What Was Fixed:**

### **Path Resolution:**
```javascript
// Before (POTENTIALLY BROKEN):
this.persistenceFile = path.join(__dirname, '../../data/upload_history.json');

// After (FIXED):
this.persistenceFile = path.join(process.cwd(), 'data', 'upload_history.json');
```

### **Debug Logging Added:**
```javascript
// In loadUploadHistory():
console.log(`Attempting to load upload history from: ${this.persistenceFile}`);
console.log(`Loaded ${this.uploadHistory.size} files from persistent storage`);

// In getUserFiles():
console.log(`Getting files for user: ${userId}, status: ${status}`);
console.log(`Total files in uploadHistory: ${this.uploadHistory.size}`);
console.log(`Found ${userFiles.length} files for user ${userId}`);
```

## 🚀 **How to Test:**

### **Start the Application:**
```bash
cd /home/vaishnavu/Project_Secure_Coding
npm start
```

### **Check Debug Output:**
Look for these messages in the terminal:
- `Attempting to load upload history from: /path/to/data/upload_history.json`
- `Created data directory: /path/to/data` (if first time)
- `No existing upload history found - starting fresh` (if no files)

### **Test File Loading:**
1. **Login:** Go to `http://localhost:3000` and login with `admin` / `Admin123!`
2. **Check My Files:** Go to "📁 My Files" tab
3. **Check Terminal:** Look for debug messages like:
   - `Getting files for user: [user-id], status: active`
   - `Total files in uploadHistory: [number]`
   - `Found [number] files for user [user-id]`

## 🔍 **Expected Debug Output:**

### **On Server Start:**
```
Attempting to load upload history from: /home/vaishnavu/Project_Secure_Coding/data/upload_history.json
Created data directory: /home/vaishnavu/Project_Secure_Coding/data
No existing upload history found - starting fresh
```

### **On File Load Request:**
```
Getting files for user: [user-id], status: active, limit: 10, offset: 0
Total files in uploadHistory: 0
Found 0 files for user [user-id]
```

### **After Uploading a File:**
```
Getting files for user: [user-id], status: active, limit: 10, offset: 0
Total files in uploadHistory: 1
Found 1 files for user [user-id]
```

## 🧪 **Testing Steps:**

### **1. Test Fresh Start**
1. Start application: `npm start`
2. Check terminal for debug messages
3. Login and go to "My Files" tab
4. Check terminal for file loading debug messages
5. ✅ **Should see "Found 0 files" (no files uploaded yet)**

### **2. Test File Upload**
1. Go to "📤 Upload Files" tab
2. Upload a test file
3. Check terminal for upload success messages
4. Go to "📁 My Files" tab
5. Check terminal for file loading debug messages
6. ✅ **Should see "Found 1 files"**

### **3. Test Persistence**
1. Upload a file
2. Stop server (Ctrl+C)
3. Start server again: `npm start`
4. Check terminal for data loading messages
5. Go to "📁 My Files" tab
6. ✅ **Should still see the uploaded file**

## 🎯 **Troubleshooting:**

### **If Still Getting "Failed to load files":**

#### **Check Terminal Output:**
Look for these specific error messages:
- `Error loading upload history: [error message]`
- `Getting files for user: [user-id]` (should appear)
- `Total files in uploadHistory: [number]` (should appear)

#### **Check Data Directory:**
```bash
ls -la /home/vaishnavu/Project_Secure_Coding/data/
cat /home/vaishnavu/Project_Secure_Coding/data/upload_history.json
```

#### **Check Browser Console:**
1. Open Developer Tools (F12)
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for JavaScript errors
4. Check Network tab for failed API requests

## 🎉 **Expected Results:**

After these fixes, you should see:
- ✅ **Clear debug output in terminal**
- ✅ **Data directory created automatically**
- ✅ **File loading debug messages**
- ✅ **No more "Failed to load files" errors**
- ✅ **Files persist across restarts**

## 🔍 **Next Steps:**

1. **Start the server** and check debug output
2. **Upload a test file** and verify it appears
3. **Check terminal logs** for any error messages
4. **Report any remaining issues** with specific error messages

**The debug output will help us identify exactly what's happening with the file loading process!**
